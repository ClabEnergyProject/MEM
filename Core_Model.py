Macro Energy Model ver. 2.0

This is the heart of the Macro Energy Model. 

Core computation code for the Macro Energy Model

This code takes two inputs:

1. A list of dictionaries in the form created by Process_Input.py.
2. A list of global (case independent) values to be used in solving the model.

Each dictionary in the list represents one technology (or demand etc) that 
can participate in the cost-optimal energy system.

The code uses these dictionary values to define a model for cvxpy to optimize.

Their are two basic elements in the model definition:

i. Technologies (which can also be generalized to include things like demand).
ii. Nodes (which provide inputs to or receive outputs from a technology)

Every technology can have inputs from or outputs to a node.

'Demand' would be an example of a "technology" that receives input but has no output.
'Wind' would be an example of a technology that produces output but has no input (although
the system is flexible enough that you could define the wind resource as the technology
has no input and have the wind resource going to a node, and then the wind turbines picking
up its input from that node.

Each technology creates capacity and/or dispatch decision variables.
Each node creates a constraining balancing equation requiring inputs to equal outputs.

A philosophic concept underlying this code is that it outputs primary output variables only.
Derived variables such as curtailments are computed in Process_Results.py.

Note that the naming convention for variables and functions are:
    
    lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.

Keywords in tech_dic are

tech_name (required) character string name of technology
node (optional) character string name of node
node_from (optional) character string name of node
fixed_cost (required if capacity decision) real number
var_cost (required if dispatch decision) real number

#%% Conceptual discussion of model code
"""
Taxonomies are tools, and so not right or wrong, but more useful or less useful.

For the purposes of this routine, we will use a high level taxonomy based on
the number of capacity decisions (one decision per simulation) and number of
dispatch decisions (one decision per time step).

It really doesn't matter whether someone wants to represent, for example, PGP
as three independent technologies vs one technology with multiple decisions.
The former approach will accomodate flexibility whereas the latter approach
may promote simplicity. In either case, this structure should accomodate both
approaches.
